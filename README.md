# R_Data_mining

This project aims to understand the knowledge extraction methods. To do this, we used RStudio. Data exploration and analysis are crucial steps in any machine learning project. In this task, we will work with the Zoo database, which contains information about various animals in a zoo. Our objective is to extract knowledge from this data using different techniques, such as association rules, hierarchical agglomerative clustering (HAC), K-means, and decision trees.
